# Stroll

Stroll is an app to track your dog walks and store notes for every walk.

## About the Application

Stroll lets you track all the things you want
to remember about your dog's walk.

Track your walks over time

- Visualize your dog's favorite spots to go!
- Mark dog-friendly establishments you find.
- Drop a reminder of public places with free bags.
- Monitor your dog's health stats.

New users can create an account utilizing passport.js.

Each user is able to create a list of multiple dogs including a profile picture.

During the walk the user can track locations of dog on dog interactions, dog friendly businesses or locations of free dog poop bags.
There is also a stop watch function to track the duration of every walk.

The user has the ability to revisit notes from past walks and compare them on a separate page.

## About the Project

A four-person team project. Beginning with a collaboration effort using Agile MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to create user stories, discuss functionality, and break-down tasks. Kanban was utilized to assign responsibility and measure work progress.

## Technology

**Node.js** - for developing the server-side of the application  
**Express** - for building the web application and handle HTTP requests  
**Passport.js** - user signup/login authentication middleware for Node.js  
**Google Maps API** - interactive map for displaying points-of-interest during dog walk  
**MySQL** - database management system  
**Sequelize** - ORM to synchronization, association and validation the application's MySQL database  
**JavaScript** - for application logic
